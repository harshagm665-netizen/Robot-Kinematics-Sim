# Robot-Kinematics-Sim
The Tech: Python, NumPy, Matplotlib, Gazebo/URDF.

What it does: "Calculates Forward and Inverse Kinematics for a robotic neck and hand assembly to ensure precise positioning in 3D space."

The Win: "Simulated motion profiles to prevent mechanical singularities and optimize actuator torque distribution."
